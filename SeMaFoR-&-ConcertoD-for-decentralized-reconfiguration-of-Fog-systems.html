<p><em>Abstract</em>: The new Fog paradigm extends the Cloud to be closer to the thing that produce and act on IoT data. However, managing Fog infrastructure is challenging because of the scalability and reliability of these heterogeneous and dynamic systems. The SeMaFoR project aims at model Fog resources, and orchestrate a fleet of autonomous controllers, each having a local view of its resources, to ease the management of Fog systems.</p>
