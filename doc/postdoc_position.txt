Location:  Nantes (France) and Montreal (Canada) with a flexible distribution of time.

Partners: Laboratoire des Sciences du Numérique de Nantes (LS2N) - France & Department of Computer Science and Operations Research (DIRO) - Univ. de Montréal - Canada. 

Research teams: Both NaoMod (https://www.ls2n.fr/equipe/naomod/?lang=en) and GEODES (http://geodes.iro.umontreal.ca/) teams are experts in Software Engineering and Modeling. In addition, NaoMod has expertise in reverse engineering and evolution/migration to software architectures of different paradigms (object, components, service, microservices, SaaS multitenancy), including migration with a clustering and optimization approach. GEODES, from its side, has an expertise in software automation using various approaches such as search-based software engineering and machine learning. 

Gross salary: 2910 €/month. 

Context: The 1-year postdoc position (1-year renewable) is available for doing research at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Software Architecture Evolution. It is funded by RFI Atlanstic 2020 (https://atlanstic2020.fr/en/) and IVADO (https://ivado.ca/en/). The project aims at coupling re-modularization and clustering techniques with machine learning techniques, in order to converge "technical" groupings with a functional breakdown. 

The selected candidate will directly work with Dalila Tamzalit and Hugo Bruneliere, both NaoMod members and professors Houari Sahraoui and Michalis Famelis, both GEODES members (as well as the other members of NaoMod and GEODES research teams whenever relevant). He/She will conduct research under the supervision of these principal investigators and hence will be involved in every step of the project. He/She will also have the opportunity to work with the team of graduate students. Moreover, he/she is expected to participate in the writing and the publication of scientific papers as well as the technical implementation of research prototypes.

The general requirements for candidates are:
 - A PhD in Computer Science or related areas obtained before the date of appointment (Sept. 1, 2021).
- Strong background in software engineering.
- An established research record
- Strong programming skills and prior experience on working with modern AI algorithms will be highly regarded.
- Good communication skills in English (both oral and writing).

To submit an application and for more information, please contact dr3am-ml@univ-nantes.fr. Applicants should provide a curriculum vitae with detailed information regarding their academic degree, research projects and publications, a cover letter with a short research statement, recommendation letter(s) and sample recent publications (including a brief justification of the rationale for picking these publications for the postdoc position).
