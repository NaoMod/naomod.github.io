  NaoMod, the Nantes Software Modeling Group, is a joint IMT Atlantique
  and LS2N research team resulting from a long-time specialization and
  research expertise on MDE (Model Driven Engineering) in the area of
  Nantes-France since 1990 (e.g. leading to the creation of the MODELS
  and ICMT conference series).
</p>

<p>
  We have been working intensively on improving and promoting the base
  techniques, best practices and actual usages of MDE by paying equally
  attention to both the academic & industrial problems, and notably
  investigating on the benefits that can be brought by a rigorous use of
  models in a software engineering context.
</p>

<p>
  From this research effort, an open source model-based toolbox is being
  developed and proposed (notably via the worldwide Eclipse Community)
  to software engineers & architects with the objective of improving
  their productivity as well as increasing the quality of the
  applications they design and build.
