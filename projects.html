  <p class="description">
    The overall approach of MegaM@Rt is to scale up the use of model-based
    techniques by offering proper methods and related tooling intera cting between
    both design time and runtime, as well as to validate the designed and developed
    approach in concrete industrial cases involving complex systems. Thanks to the
    model-based method, different systems will be able to communicate through the
    entire development chain, and moreover it will be possible for systems in
    operation to feed back the collected data for continued development
