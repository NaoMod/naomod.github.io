  <h3><a href="https://mosaico-project.eu/">MOSAICO</a></h3>
  <span class="project-type">Horizon Europe - Research and Innovation Action (January 2025 - December 2027)</span>
  <p class="projet-description">
    MOSAICO is a research and innovation European project that aims to transform 
software development with a collaborative ecosystem of AI agents. The project 
will create a platform where AI tools and developers interact seamlessly to 
automate key tasks—requirements analysis, code generation, testing, and 
deployment—boosting efficiency and software quality. With a strong focus on 
ethical AI and user-friendly interfaces, MOSAICO seeks to enhance developer 
productivity and open new possibilities for innovation in software engineering.

  <h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/matisse-project-kdt">MATISSE</a></h3>
  <span class="project-type">Horizon KDT JU - Europe (September 2024 - August 2027)</span>
  <p class="projet-description">
    MATISSE creates a framework incorporating methods and tools for 
the efficient and continuous engineering and validation of industrial 
systems. This is supported by Digital Twins leveraging the advantages 
of model-based, data-driven (including AI/ML), and cloud techniques to 
enable validation and verification services that improve productivity and 
quality significantly.

  <h3><a href="https://www.aidoart.eu/">AIDOaRt</a></h3>
  <span class="project-type">H2020 ECSEL JU - Europe (April 2021 - September 2024)</span>
  <p class="projet-description">
    Following-up the MegaM@Rt project (cf. below), AIDOaRt investigated
the AI-augmented automation of software and systems engineering activities 
such as modeling, coding, testing and monitoring in order to address the 
challenge of the continuous development of large-scale industrial 
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs).

  <h3><a href="https://www.lowcomote.eu/">Lowcomote</a></h3>
  <span class="project-type">H2020 ITN - Europe (January 2019 - June 2023)</span>
  <p class="projet-description">
    Low-code development platforms allow non-programmers to build full 
applications by interacting through dynamic graphical user interfaces, 
visual diagrams and declarative languages. Lowcomote is an international 
project aiming at training 15 PhD students, with the potential to become 
the leaders of tomorrow engineering of low-code development plateforms..

  <h3><a href="https://megamart2-ecsel.eu/">MegaM@Rt</a></h3>
  <span class="project-type">H2020 ECSEL JU - Europe (April 2017 - March 2020)</span>
  <p class="projet-description">
    The overall approach of MegaM@Rt is to scale up the use of model-based
techniques by offering proper methods and related tooling intera cting
between both design time and runtime, as well as to validate the designed
and developed approach in concrete industrial cases involving complex 
systems. Thanks to the model-based method, different systems are be 
able to communicate through the entire development chain, and moreover 
it is possible for systems in operation to feed back the collected 
data for continued development

  <h3><a href="https://rodic.ls2n.fr/">RODIC</a></h3>
  <span class="project-type">ANR - France (March 2022 - February 2026)</span>
  <p class="projet-description">
    RODIC considers how Software Engineering will help Industry 4.0 when
reconfiguring production chains by the use of techniques and platforms
based on Model-Driven Engineering, Domain-Specific Languages (DSL),
Software Testing, Human-Machine Interfaces. The approach of RODIC is to
consider most of the reconfiguration using the same models for the
definition, verification, evaluation, validation, and code generation.

  <h3><a href="https://semafor.gitlab.io/">SeMaFoR</a></h3>
  <span class="project-type">ANR - France (Mars 2021 - February 2025)</span>
  <p class="projet-description">
    SeMaFoR aims at modeling, designing and coordinating decentralized Fog systems in 
a generic way by using a dedicated Architecture Description Language (ADL), a 
collaborative / consensual decision process and a mechanism for the automated 
coordination of reconfigurations.

  <span class="project-type">Pôle EMC2 2020 - France (May 2021 - November 2022)</span>
  <p class="projet-description">
    Ecoplex aims at developing an approach and software for integrating Life Cycle 
Analysis to Model-Based Systems Engineering to support the ecodesign of complex 
systems. The project includes partners in the shipbuilding and software industry, 
funded through a call for collaborative innovation among SMEs in Pays de la Loire 
and Brittany.
