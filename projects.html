  - title: AIDOaRt
    website: https://www.aidoart.eu/
    funder: H2020 ECSEL JU - Europe
    type: International funded project
    start_date: April 2021
    end_date: Mars 2024
    desc: |
      Following-up the MegaM@Rt project (cf. below), AIDOaRt will investigate
      the AI-augmented automation of software engineering activities such as 
      modeling, coding, testing and monitoring in order to address the 
      challenge of the continuous development of large-scale industrial 
      Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs).


  - title: Lowcomote
    website: https://www.lowcomote.eu/
    funder: H2020 ITN - Europe
    type: International funded project
    start_date: January 2019
    end_date: December 2022
    desc: |
      Low-code development platforms allow non-programmers to build full 
      applications by interacting through dynamic graphical user interfaces, 
      visual diagrams and declarative languages. Lowcomote is an international 
      project aiming at training 15 PhD students, with the potential to become 
      the leaders of tomorrow engineering of low-code development plateforms..

  - title: MegaM@Rt
    website: https://megamart2-ecsel.eu/
    funder: H2020 ECSEL JU - Europe
    type: International funded project
    start_date: April 2017 
    end_date: Mars 2020
    desc: |
      The overall approach of MegaM@Rt is to scale up the use of model-based
      techniques by offering proper methods and related tooling intera cting
      between both design time and runtime, as well as to validate the designed
        and developed approach in concrete industrial cases involving complex 
        systems. Thanks to the model-based method, different systems will be 
        able to communicate through the entire development chain, and moreover 
        it will be possible for systems in operation to feed back the collected 
        data for continued development

  - title: RODIC 
    funder: ANR - France
    type: National funded project
    start_date: Mars 2022
    end_date: February 2022
    desc: |
      RODIC considers how Software Engineering will help Industry 4.0 when
      reconfiguring production chains by the use of techniques and platforms
      based on Model-Driven Engineering, Domain-Specific Languages (DSL),
      Software Testing, Human-Machine Interfaces. The approach of RODIC is to
      consider most of the reconfiguration using the same models for the
      definition, verification, evaluation, validation, and code generation.

  - title: SeMaFoR 
    website: https://semafor.gitlab.io/
    funder: ANR - France
    type: National funded project
    start_date: Mars 2021
    end_date: February 2025
    desc: |
      SeMaFoR aims at modeling, designing and coordinating decentralized Fog systems in 
      a generic way by using a dedicated Architecture Description Language (ADL), a 
      collaborative / consensual decision process and a mechanism for the automated 
      coordination of reconfigurations.

  - title: EcoPlex
    website: https://www.ecoplex.fr
    funder:  PÃ´le EMC2 2020 - France
    type: National funded project
    start_date: Maxy 2021
    end_date: Novembre 2022
    desc: |
      Ecoplex aims at developing an approach and software for integrating Life Cycle 
      Analysis to Model-Based Systems Engineering to support the ecodesign of complex 
      systems. The project includes partners in the shipbuilding and software industry, 
      funded through a call for collaborative innovation among SMEs in Pays de la Loire 
      and Brittany.

  - title: DR3AM-ML 
    funder: Atlanstic 2020 - France 
    type: National funded project
    start_date: 2021
    end_date: 2022
    desc: |
      DR3AM-ML aims at facilitating the (semi-)automated identification of possible
      microservices for the migration of already existing applications to modern 
      (microservices-based) architectures, by combining metaheuristic optimization with 
      Machine Learning techniques.
