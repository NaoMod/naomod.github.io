  - title: MOSAICO
    website: https://mosaico-project.eu/
    funder: Horizon Europe - Research and Innovation Action
    type: International funded project
    start_date: January 2025
    end_date: December 2027
    desc: |
      MOSAICO is a research and innovation European project that aims to transform 
      software development with a collaborative ecosystem of AI agents. The project 
      will create a platform where AI tools and developers interact seamlessly to 
      automate key tasks—requirements analysis, code generation, testing, and 
      deployment—boosting efficiency and software quality. With a strong focus on 
      ethical AI and user-friendly interfaces, MOSAICO seeks to enhance developer 
      productivity and open new possibilities for innovation in software engineering.

  - title: MATISSE
    website: https://matisse-kdt.eu/
    funder: Horizon KDT JU - Europe
    type: International funded project
    start_date: September 2024
    end_date: August 2027
    desc: |
      MATISSE creates a framework incorporating methods and tools for 
      the efficient and continuous engineering and validation of industrial 
      systems. This is supported by Digital Twins leveraging the advantages 
      of model-based, data-driven (including AI/ML), and cloud techniques to 
      enable validation and verification services that improve productivity and 
      quality significantly.

  - title: AIDOaRt
    website: https://www.aidoart.eu/
    funder: H2020 ECSEL JU - Europe
    type: International funded project
    start_date: April 2021
    end_date: September 2024
    desc: |
      Following-up the MegaM@Rt project (cf. below), AIDOaRt investigated
      the AI-augmented automation of software and systems engineering activities 
      such as modeling, coding, testing and monitoring in order to address the 
      challenge of the continuous development of large-scale industrial 
      Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs).


  - title: Lowcomote
    website: https://www.lowcomote.eu/
    funder: H2020 ITN - Europe
    type: International funded project
    start_date: January 2019
    end_date: June 2023
    desc: |
      Low-code development platforms allow non-programmers to build full 
      applications by interacting through dynamic graphical user interfaces, 
      visual diagrams and declarative languages. Lowcomote is an international 
      project aiming at training 15 PhD students, with the potential to become 
      the leaders of tomorrow engineering of low-code development plateforms..

  - title: MegaM@Rt
    website: https://megamart2-ecsel.eu/
    funder: H2020 ECSEL JU - Europe
    type: International funded project
    start_date: April 2017 
    end_date: March 2020
    desc: |
      The overall approach of MegaM@Rt is to scale up the use of model-based
      techniques by offering proper methods and related tooling intera cting
      between both design time and runtime, as well as to validate the designed
      and developed approach in concrete industrial cases involving complex 
      systems. Thanks to the model-based method, different systems are be 
      able to communicate through the entire development chain, and moreover 
      it is possible for systems in operation to feed back the collected 
      data for continued development

  - title: RODIC 
    website: https://rodic.ls2n.fr/
    funder: ANR - France
    type: National funded project
    start_date: March 2022
    end_date: February 2026
    desc: |
      RODIC considers how Software Engineering will help Industry 4.0 when
      reconfiguring production chains by the use of techniques and platforms
      based on Model-Driven Engineering, Domain-Specific Languages (DSL),
      Software Testing, Human-Machine Interfaces. The approach of RODIC is to
      consider most of the reconfiguration using the same models for the
      definition, verification, evaluation, validation, and code generation.

  - title: SeMaFoR 
    website: https://semafor.gitlab.io/
    funder: ANR - France
    type: National funded project
    start_date: Mars 2021
    end_date: August 2025
    desc: |
      SeMaFoR aims at modeling, designing and coordinating decentralized Fog systems in 
      a generic way by using a dedicated Architecture Description Language (ADL), a 
      collaborative / consensual decision process and a mechanism for the automated 
      coordination of reconfigurations.

  - title: EcoPlex
    website: https://www.ecoplex.fr
    funder:  Pôle EMC2 2020 - France
    type: National funded project
    start_date: May 2021
    end_date: November 2022
    desc: |
      Ecoplex aims at developing an approach and software for integrating Life Cycle 
      Analysis to Model-Based Systems Engineering to support the ecodesign of complex 
      systems. The project includes partners in the shipbuilding and software industry, 
      funded through a call for collaborative innovation among SMEs in Pays de la Loire 
      and Brittany.
