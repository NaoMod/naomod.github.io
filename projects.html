<h2>International funded projects</h2>

<section>
  <h3>AIDOaRt</h3>
  <span class="project-type">H2020 ECSEL JU - Europe (April 2021 - Mars 2024)</span>
  <p class="description">
    Following-up the MegaM@Rt project (cf. below), AIDOaRt will investigate the AI-augmented 
    automation of software engineering activities such as modeling, coding, testing and 
    monitoring in order to address the challenge of the continuous development of 
    large-scale industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs).

  <h3><a href="https://www.lowcomote.eu/">Lowcomote</a></h3>
  <span class="project-type">H2020 ITN - Europe (January 2019 - December 2022)</span>
  <p class="description">
    Low-code development platforms allow non-programmers to build full
    applications by interacting through dynamic graphical user interfaces,
    visual diagrams and declarative languages.  Lowcomote is an international
    project aiming at training 15 PhD students, with the potential to become the
    leaders of tomorrow engineering of low-code development plateforms.

  <h3><a href="https://megamart2-ecsel.eu/">MegaM@Rt</a></h3>
  <span class="project-type">H2020 ECSEL JU - Europe (April 2017 - Mars 2020)</span>
  <p class="description">
    The overall approach of MegaM@Rt is to scale up the use of model-based
    techniques by offering proper methods and related tooling intera cting between
    both design time and runtime, as well as to validate the designed and developed
    approach in concrete industrial cases involving complex systems. Thanks to the
    model-based method, different systems will be able to communicate through the
    entire development chain, and moreover it will be possible for systems in
    operation to feed back the collected data for continued development

<h2>National funded projects</h2>

<section>
  <h3><a href="https://semafor.gitlab.io/">SeMaFoR</a></h3>
  <span class="project-type">ANR - France (Mars 2021 - February 2025)</span>
  <p class="description">
    SeMaFoR aims at modeling, designing and coordinating decentralized Fog systems in 
    a generic way by using a dedicated Architecture Description Language (ADL), a 
    collaborative / consensual decision process and a mechanism for the automated
    coordination of reconfigurations.
